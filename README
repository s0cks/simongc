SimonGC is a generational garbage collector designed for LLVM.

The runtime is written in pure C, so apart from the compiler-specific bindings,
the garbage collector can be used by any system.

Build Instructions
------------------

Get a copy of the LLVM source from llvm.org. Unpack where you'd like.

You probably have to build LLVM before you can build SimonGC. Follow the
LLVM build instructions, which are pretty straight-forward.

Put SimonGC in llvm/lib/SimonGC, and run make within. All done!

Run tests in SimonGC/runtime/test.



Have fun!
